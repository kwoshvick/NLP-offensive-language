It is possible to live in a society where both male and female genders are respected
Sharing roles in the house is possible, I doubt there is a particular role for the different genders
I recently helped a help a victim of violence by telling him or her where to report cases of gender violence
I encourage all fathers to show affection toward their children and not impose fear on them or violate their rights
It is sad that both men and women are victims of domestic violence
This situation is not specific to any gender
There is no problem with the girl-child or boy-child
Cooking is a survival tactic that must be adopted by both genders
A boy is as criminal as a girl and a girl is as empathetic as a boy
The time had come for all to speak with one voice and take a stand: male or female
